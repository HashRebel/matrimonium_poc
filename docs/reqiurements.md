# Idea
Marriage dApp. Basically a dApp for making a marriage proposal. Should assist from engagement to wedding. You can order wedding rings and engagement rings with the blockchain address to the engagement and wedding contracts. 

Might be able to play with currency as well (maybe wedding planing and wedding gifts?) and can call it Dowry

I should be able to send a marriage proposal which puts the contract into the engagement period. This period can have an expiration or be left limitless. Once the couple (or multiple parties) have their wedding the contract is turned into a marriage commitment once the couple signs with the state.

Could have a fun option where the app is sent to all the invited wedding guests. This can then be used for things like registries, guest book (Maybe even use the app to decentralize the wedding and ask guests to just pitch in or something. gotta think about that).

Something cool that we could do with the wedding attendance is have them all sign up through the dApp and when the marriage licence is being signed, everyone can be asked to vote for the couple to be married. This way everyone is a part of the process, everyone gets to put their name on the contract and everyone has a say in the ultimate marriage. We could emphasize this to the attendance by explaining that the blockchain is forever, so everyone who wants to be a witness to our love for the immutable future only needs to sign up through our dapp and the dapp will walk them through the rest.

Could be really fun to tokenize this too. Maybe you can have marriage champagnes where guests can buy special ceremony tokens specific to the couple (or group). So for Anna and I we could offer Butters (BUTT!!!! YES please!) for our tokens.

# Goals:
The initial goal of this app is to use it in order to propose to the love of my life and my life partner and have it etched into the blockchain for the rest of our existence on this plane. I wanted a way to profess my love forever and in a more meaningful way then a state sanctioned wedding. I wanted some way to profess our love and have it truly last forever and for that to be witnessed by those we love where it can be etched into history.

Long term I would love for this app to be extended to help the entire marriage process. Could provide services to help the wedding plans, easy help with gift registries and invite lists, honeymoon planning, and much more.

The app could also just be used to a hookup protection, although I think this gets into ethical grounds and should be though through a lot deeper and with a lot more peer review.

# MVP
For the MVP I would simply like to have a dapp that I can send to my partner in order to propose for marriage. My partner should be able to signup and respond and the decisions should be recorded onto a blockchain. During the sign up process the identity of the proposed should be gathered in order to imprint the actual identity of the proposed and proposer for recording into the blockchain. (Consider uPort or Civil).

## Stories
As a proposed I should be able to reject a request so that the contract can be closed and the identity of the partner should not be collected or recorded onto the blockchain



Only upon signing the contract shall the proposal be recorded.

I should allow my partner to be able to signup through their Google account to expedite some of the effort.



# Epics:

### As a user I should fall into one of the following roles:
* Proposer - This is a user who initially signs up in order to send a proposal request their partner(s) 
* Proposed - This is a user who receives a proposal request
* Engaged - Once a proposal is excepted both users become engaged and now need %100 agreement among both parties to do anything. Also, this state allows the users to have access to planning functionality and tools. 
* Witness - These are the ceremony guests and will have access to things like gift registries, signing a guestbook and signing the marriage contract as witnesses (maybe access to buy a special marriage token).


### As a user I should be able to send the following contract (better word?) requests to another person
* consensual sex (could be interesting to have an easy way to quickly consent to sex. I am thinking that this could be severely missuses though but we might want to think of some game theory to minimize abuse.)
* marriage proposal (what else can we call it?)
* marriage commitment

#### Acceptance
A request is sent to the appropriate person

---

### As a proposer I should be able to send my partner(s) a proposal through text

### As a proposed I should be able to reject the request without having to sign up

### As a proposed I should be able to sign up for the dApp before accepting or rejecting
